## 2. About Me

"Hello! I’m a Final Year CS student at Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) with a 8.44 CGPA and a passion for engineering systems that scale.

My journey isn't just about syntax; it's about solving real-world friction. Whether it’s building a multi-model AI platform like English-Tutor-AI, orchestrating 9-stream video synchronization, or leading a digital preservation initiative for a community of 200 million, I thrive at the intersection of efficiency and impact.

As the founder of CatCatchCode, I'm currently mentoring the next generation of developers by bridging the gap between university theory and industry-grade engineering."
